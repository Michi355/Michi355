## Hi there 👋
 
## Pronouns: they/them

I currently just finished working on:

## 🍳 Cooking Rhythm Game – CSE 110 Team Project

This is a browser-based cooking game built with **TypeScript, Konva.js, and Vite**.  
Players complete kitchen tasks and mini games under time pressure, including a rhythm-based ingredient catching mode synchronized to music.

### 🧠 My Contributions
* Co-Built a **fully playable rhythm mini-game**
  * Lane system + DFJK key input
  * Hit detection timing window for music
  * Implemented music and music-game logic
  * Changed rhythm to match music bpm
* Implemented **Easy / Hard difficulty selection**
* Integrated **screen switching + game state logic**
* Added/implemented custom **pixel-art assets**
* Helped with **Git merging + conflict resolution**
* Assisted in creating and implementing Player inventory
* Implemented ingredient boxes that spawns ingredients

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* TypeScript
* Konva.js (Canvas rendering)
* Vite
* Modular Model / View / Controller structure

> 🔒 Repo is private (class project), but happy to explain the system design and code structure if asked.
